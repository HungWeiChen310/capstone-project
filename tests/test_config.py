    # A more robust solution involves changing Config to a class that loads on
    # instantiation or via a method.

    # For this test, let's assume we'd need to re-import or have a load method.
    # To keep it simple and test the getenv part:
    assert os.getenv("FLASK_DEBUG").lower() == "true"

    # config_instance = Config()  # Assuming Config() would load from env
